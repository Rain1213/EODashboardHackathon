The longer human activities are changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the more visible, wider, and longer lasting the scope of environmental impacts may be. Your challenge is to tell a visual story about the impacts of the pandemic using Earth observation data and other complementary information.

## **Summary**
With the ongoing pandemic crushing our morale, it has been difficult to look at the positive side of things. However, a silver lining has certainly come in the fight against environmental degradation. While all humans were trapped inside their houses, the air, water and soil quality did improve. With human intervention out of the picture nature has had time to heal herself. Our project will demonstrate the positive after-effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic which includes an increase in the quality of air and water and reduction of greenhouse gases and pollution. However, with the revival of the economy a question does loom; “Will It Be Business As Usual?”

## **What did we develop?**
The challenge was to tell a story on the effects of COVID-19 on the Environment. We chose to show the positive effects of the pandemic on the environment which mainly focuses on the increase of air quality levels with a wide decline in pollution.

We have prepared a video that would better explain our project.We tried our best to represent it as an appealing and brief note.

Our objective is to use the data given to use and raise public awareness. The rise in air quality is a second chance; another opportunity given to us by mother nature herself. Let us preserve and sustain our environment, lets not go back to 'pre-covid' levels of pollution. Lets show the Earth that we care and we can change.
